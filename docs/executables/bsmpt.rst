BSMPT
==============

BSMPT calculates the strength of a single-step electroweak phase transition (EWPT), defined as the ratio of the vacuum expectation value (VEV) at the critical temperature :math:`v_c` over the critical temperature :math:`T_c`, based on finding a discontinuity in the electroweak VEV of the temperature-dependent global minimum.
