Test
==============

Test checks the model implementation for a provided parameter point. Some of the performed tests are e.g.: matching fermion masses and tree-level electroweak minimum with SM, tadpole relations, matching scalar masses between tree-level and NLO and symmetries of the coupling-tensors. The number of passed/failed tests is reported.
